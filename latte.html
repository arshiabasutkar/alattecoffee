  <h2>How to Make a Latte</h2>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Espresso or strongly brewed coffee from an Aeropress</li>
    <li>2% or nonfat milk</li>
    <li>Cocoa powder, to garnish</li>
    <li>Wide, shallow coffee cup</li>
    <li>Jar with lid</li>
    <li>Spoon</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Make your espresso or strongly brewed coffee.</li>
    <li>Pour milk into the jar. Fill no more than halfway. Screw the lid on tightly, and shake the jar for 30-60 seconds or until the milk is frothy and has roughly doubled in volume.</li>
    <li>Take the lid off the jar and microwave uncovered for 30 seconds. The foam will rise to the top of the milk.</li>
    <li>Pour the espresso or coffee into a wide, shallow coffee cup. Use a large spoon to hold back the milk foam, and pour as much warm milk as you would like into the espresso.</li>
    <li>Spoon as much milk foam as you would like onto your coffee. Garnish, if desired, with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or nutmeg on top of the foam.</li>
    <li>Sip immediately!</li>
  </ol>
